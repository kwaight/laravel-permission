##This package includes support for a Multi-tenant database, that is the only difference from the core package

With this package you can assign roles access to tenants.  This package simply extends the core package and does not overwrite anything.

####New functions


Get a list of all roles and tenants assigned to the user
```php
$user->tenants;
```

Give permission via a role to a user for a tenant
```php
$user->assignRoleToTenant($roleId, $tenantId);

// you may pass a class
$user->assignRoleToTenant($role, $tenant);

// or a name
$user->assignRoleToTenant('writer', 'The Chronicle');
```

Determine if user has permission to tenant via role

**Note:** Direct permissions are not supported at this time
```php
$user->hasPermissionToTenant('delete articles', $tenant);

// you may also check via tenant name
$user->hasPermissionToTenant('delete articles', 'The Chronicle');
```

If you would like to revoke permissions you can do so by
```php
$user->removeRoleFromTenant('admin', $tenant);

// you may also check via tenant name
$user->hasPermissionToTenant('admin', 'The Chronicle');
```

We've included a couple of blade helpers too
```php
@haspermission('edit articles', 'The Chronicle')
    I am a writer!
@else
    I am not a writer...
@endhaspermission
```

##Overview
This package allows you to manage user permissions and roles in a database.

Once installed you can do stuff like this:

```php
// Adding permissions to a user
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles');

// Adding permissions via a role
$user->assignRole('writer');

$role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

You can also remove permissions
```php
```
If you're using multiple guards we've got you covered as well. Every guard will have its own set of permissions and roles that can be assigned to the guard's users. Read about it in the [using multiple guards](#using-multiple-guards) section of the readme.

Because all permissions will be registered on [Laravel's gate](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/authorization), you can test if a user has a permission with Laravel's default `can` function:

```php
$user->can('edit articles');
```

## Installation

This package can be used in Laravel 5.4 or higher. If you are using an older version of Laravel, take a look at [the v1 branch of this package](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission/tree/v1).

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-permission
```

In Laravel 5.5 the service provider will automatically get registered. In older versions of the framework just add the service provider in `config/app.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider::class,
];
```

You can publish [the migration](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission/blob/master/database/migrations/create_permission_tables.php.stub) with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

After the migration has been published you can create the role- and permission-tables by running the migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

When published, [the `config/permission.php` config file](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission/blob/master/config/permission.php) contains:

```php

## Usage

First add the `Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasRoles` trait to your `User` model(s):

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasTenants;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasTenants;

    // ...
}
```

> - note that if you need to use `HasTenants` trait with another model ex.`Page` you will also need to add `protected $guard_name = 'web';` as well to that model or you would get an error
>
>```php
>use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
>use Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasRoles;
>
>class Page extends Model
>{
>    use HasRoles;
>
>    protected $guard_name = 'web'; // or whatever guard you want to use
>
>    // ...
>}
>```

This package allows for users to be associated with permissions and roles. Every role is associated with multiple permissions.
A `Role` and a `Permission` are regular Eloquent models. They require a `name` and can be created like this:

```php
use Spatie\Permission\Models\Role;
use Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission;

$role = Role::create(['name' => 'writer']);
$permission = Permission::create(['name' => 'edit articles']);
```

If you're using multiple guards the `guard_name` attribute needs to be set as well. Read about it in the [using multiple guards](#using-multiple-guards) section of the readme.

The `HasRoles` trait adds Eloquent relationships to your models, which can be accessed directly or used as a base query:

```php
// get a list of all permissions directly assigned to the user
$permissions = $user->permissions;

// get all permissions inherited by the user via roles
$permissions = $user->getAllPermissions();

// get a collection of all defined roles
$roles = $user->roles->pluck('name'); // Returns a collection
```

The `HasRoles` trait also adds a scope to your models to scope the query to certain roles:

```php
$users = User::role('writer')->get(); // Returns only users with the role 'writer'
```

The scope can accept a string, a `\Spatie\Permission\Models\Role` object or an `\Illuminate\Support\Collection` object.

### Using "direct" permissions (see below to use both roles and permissions)

A permission can be given to any user:

```php
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles');

// You can also give multiple permission at once
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles', 'delete articles');

// You may also pass an array
$user->givePermissionTo(['edit articles', 'delete articles']);
```

A permission can be revoked from a user:

```php
$user->revokePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

Or revoke & add new permissions in one go:

```php
$user->syncPermissions(['edit articles', 'delete articles']);
```

You can test if a user has a permission:

```php
$user->hasPermissionTo('edit articles');
```

...or if a user has multiple permissions:

```php
$user->hasAnyPermission(['edit articles', 'publish articles', 'unpublish articles']);
```

Saved permissions will be registered with the `Illuminate\Auth\Access\Gate` class for the default guard. So you can
test if a user has a permission with Laravel's default `can` function:

```php
$user->can('edit articles');
```

### Using permissions via roles

A role can be assigned to any user:

```php
$user->assignRole('writer');

// You can also assign multiple roles at once
$user->assignRole('writer', 'admin');
// or as an array
$user->assignRole(['writer', 'admin']);
```

A role can be removed from a user:

```php
$user->removeRole('writer');
```

Roles can also be synced:

```php
// All current roles will be removed from the user and replaced by the array given
$user->syncRoles(['writer', 'admin']);
```

You can determine if a user has a certain role:

```php
$user->hasRole('writer');
```

You can also determine if a user has any of a given list of roles:

```php
$user->hasAnyRole(Role::all());
```

You can also determine if a user has all of a given list of roles:

```php
$user->hasAllRoles(Role::all());
```

The `assignRole`, `hasRole`, `hasAnyRole`, `hasAllRoles`  and `removeRole` functions can accept a
 string, a `\Spatie\Permission\Models\Role` object or an `\Illuminate\Support\Collection` object.

A permission can be given to a role:

```php
$role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

You can determine if a role has a certain permission:

```php
$role->hasPermissionTo('edit articles');
```

A permission can be revoked from a role:

```php
$role->revokePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

The `givePermissionTo` and `revokePermissionTo` functions can accept a
string or a `Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission` object.


Permissions are inherited from roles automatically. 
Additionally, individual permissions can be assigned to the user too. 
For instance:

```php
$role = Role::findByName('writer');
$role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');

$user->assignRole('writer');

$user->givePermissionTo('delete articles');
```

In the above example a role is given permission to edit articles and this role is assigned to a user. 
Now the user can edit articles and additionally delete articles. The permission of 'delete articles' is the user's direct permission because it is assigned directly to them.
When we call `$user->hasDirectPermission('delete articles')` it returns `true`, 
but `false` for `$user->hasDirectPermission('edit articles')`.

This method is useful if one builds a form for setting permissions for roles and users in an application and wants to restrict or change inherited permissions of roles of the user, i.e. allowing to change only direct permissions of the user.

You can list all of these permissions:

```php
// Direct permissions
$user->getDirectPermissions() // Or $user->permissions;

// Permissions inherited from the user's roles
$user->getPermissionsViaRoles();

// All permissions which apply on the user (inherited and direct)
$user->getAllPermissions();
```

All these responses are collections of `Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission` objects.

If we follow the previous example, the first response will be a collection with the 'delete article' permission, the
second will be a collection with the 'edit article' permission and the third will contain both.

### Using Blade directives
This package also adds Blade directives to verify whether the currently logged in user has all or any of a given list of roles. 

Optionally you can pass in the `guard` that the check will be performed on as a second argument.

#### Blade and Roles
Test for a specific role:
```php
@role('writer')
    I am a writer!
@else
    I am not a writer...
@endrole
```
is the same as
```php
@hasrole('writer')
    I am a writer!
@else
    I am not a writer...
@endhasrole
```

Test for any role in a list:
```php
@hasanyrole(Role::all())
    I have one or more of these roles!
@else
    I have none of these roles...
@endhasanyrole
// or
@hasanyrole('writer|admin')
    I am either a writer or an admin or both!
@else
    I have none of these roles...
@endhasanyrole
```
Test for all roles:

```php
@hasallroles(Role::all())
    I have all of these roles!
@else
    I do not have all of these roles...
@endhasallroles
// or
@hasallroles('writer|admin')
    I am both a writer and an admin!
@else
    I do not have all of these roles...
@endhasallroles
```

#### Blade and Permissions
This package doesn't add any permission-specific Blade directives. Instead, use Laravel's native `@can` directive to check if a user has a certain permission.

```php
@can('edit articles')
  //
@endcan
```
or
```php
@if(auth()->user()->can('edit articles') && $some_other_condition)
  //
@endif
```

## Using multiple guards

When using the default Laravel auth configuration all of the above methods will work out of the box, no extra configuration required.

However when using multiple guards they will act like namespaces for your permissions and roles. Meaning every guard has its own set of permissions and roles that can be assigned to their user model.

### Using permissions and roles with multiple guards

By default the default guard (`config('auth.default.guard')`) will be used as the guard for new permissions and roles. When creating permissions and roles for specific guards you'll have to specify their `guard_name` on the model:

```php
// Create a superadmin role for the admin users
$role = Role::create(['guard_name' => 'admin', 'name' => 'superadmin']);

// Define a `publish articles` permission for the admin users belonging to the admin guard
$permission = Permission::create(['guard_name' => 'admin', 'name' => 'publish articles']);

// Define a *different* `publish articles` permission for the regular users belonging to the web guard
$permission = Permission::create(['guard_name' => 'web', 'name' => 'publish articles']);
```

To check if a user has permission for a specific guard:

```php
$user->hasPermissionTo('publish articles', 'admin');
```

### Assigning permissions and roles to guard users

You can use the same methods to assign permissions and roles to users as described above in [using permissions via roles](#using-permissions-via-roles). Just make sure the `guard_name` on the permission or role matches the guard of the user, otherwise a `GuardDoesNotMatch` exception will be thrown.

### Using blade directives with multiple guards

You can use all of the blade directives listed in [using blade directives](#using-blade-directives) by passing in the guard you wish to use as the second argument to the directive:

```php
@role('super-admin', 'admin')
    I am a super-admin!
@else
    I am not a super-admin...
@endrole
```

## Using a middleware

This package comes with `RoleMiddleware` and `PermissionMiddleware` middleware. You can add them inside your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

```php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    // ...
    'role' => \Spatie\Permission\Middlewares\RoleMiddleware::class,
    'permission' => \Spatie\Permission\Middlewares\PermissionMiddleware::class,
];
```

Then you can protect your routes using middleware rules:

```php
Route::group(['middleware' => ['role:super-admin']], function () {
    //
});

Route::group(['middleware' => ['permission:publish articles']], function () {
    //
});

Route::group(['middleware' => ['role:super-admin','permission:publish articles']], function () {
    //
});
```
You can protect your controllers similarly, by setting desired middleware in the constructor:

```php
public function __construct
{
    $this->middleware(['role:super-admin','permission:publish articles']);
}
```

## Using artisan commands

You can create a role or permission from console with artisan commands.

```bash
php artisan permission:create-role writer
```

```bash
php artisan permission:create-permission 'edit articles'
```

When creating permissions and roles for specific guards you can specify the guard names as a second argument:

```bash
php artisan permission:create-role writer web
```

```bash
php artisan permission:create-permission 'edit articles' web
```

## Database Seeding

Two notes about Database Seeding:

1. It is best to flush the `spatie.permission.cache` before seeding, to avoid cache conflict errors. This can be done from an Artisan command (see Troubleshooting: Cache section, later) or directly in a seeder class (see example below).

2. Here's a sample seeder, which clears the cache, creates permissions, and then assigns permissions to roles:

	```php
	use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
	use Spatie\Permission\Models\Role;
	use Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission;

	class RolesAndPermissionsSeeder extends Seeder
	{
	    public function run()
    	{
        	// Reset cached roles and permissions
	        app()['cache']->forget('spatie.permission.cache');

	        // create permissions
	        Permission::create(['name' => 'edit articles']);
	        Permission::create(['name' => 'delete articles']);
	        Permission::create(['name' => 'publish articles']);
	        Permission::create(['name' => 'unpublish articles']);

	        // create roles and assign existing permissions
	        $role = Role::create(['name' => 'writer']);
	        $role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');
	        $role->givePermissionTo('delete articles');

	        $role = Role::create(['name' => 'admin']);
	        $role->givePermissionTo('publish articles');
	        $role->givePermissionTo('unpublish articles');
	    }
	}

	```

## Extending

If you need to extend or replace the existing `Role` or `Permission` models you just need to
keep the following things in mind:

- Your `Role` model needs to implement the `Spatie\Permission\Contracts\Role` contract
- Your `Permission` model needs to implement the `Spatie\Permission\Contracts\Permission` contract
- You can publish the configuration with this command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```
  
  And update the `models.role` and `models.permission` values

## Troubleshooting

### Cache

If you manipulate permission/role data directly in the database instead of calling the supplied methods, then you will not see the changes reflected in the application, because role and permission data is cached to speed up performance.

To manually reset the cache for this package, run:
```bash
php artisan cache:forget spatie.permission.cache
```

When you use the supplied methods, such as the following, the cache is automatically reset for you:

```php
// see earlier in the README for how these methods work:
$user->assignRole('writer');
$user->removeRole('writer');
$role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');
$role->revokePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

## Need a UI?

The package doesn't come with any screens out of the box, you should build that yourself. To get started check out [this extensive tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/user-authorization-in-laravel-54-with-spatie-laravel-permission) by [Caleb Oki](http://www.caleboki.com/).
